	\item \textit{What are the advantages and disadvantages of using the same system call interface for manipulating both files and devices?}
	\newline
	\newline
	The advantage of this is that they are easier for the user to understand. Also, this makes it easier to introduce new device drivers. The disadvantage is that some devices may not be able to use their full functionality by interfacing with them like this.
	
	\item \textit{Would it be possible for the user to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface provided by the operating system? How?}
	\newline
	\newline
	Yes, the user should be able to develop a new command interpreter using the system call interface provided by the OS. The command interpreter allows users to create new processes. This should all be possible through system calls.
